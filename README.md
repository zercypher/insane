## Introduction

With the development modern hardware and advanced techniques, several game engines are being developed and maintained.
Introduction and wide-spread adaptation of __Vulkan__, __DirectX 12__, their support for _Ray tracing_, _Path Tracing_ etc
has left game engines to retain their original codebase, which were intially developed for older APIs and technologies. As a
result, the newer functionalities are either completely ignored or integrated within the original design with special adaptors
or APIs. Although, this is not a completely bad, with the wide-spread availability of newer APIs, it is best to develop game
engines that are both targeting specific purpose (Such as _Procedural Generation_, _Open World_, _Multiplayer_ etc) and
specific platforms to achieve peak efficiency.

Insane engine tries to target _Procedural Generation_ and _Open World_ as its only prime directive. Support for all platform
is planned with Windows and Linux top on the list.
